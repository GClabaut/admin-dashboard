# admin-dashboard

In this Odin project, we were given a page to reproduce. Of course, we don't have to be pixel perfect, but I do believe we had to get close.

Of course, this was supposed to be a simple project. As such, I didn't try to make it responsive. There is no media query, nor did I use any minmax, calc, clamp, etc. Of course, since I already used a lot of grid, it will be somewhat responsive from the get-go, but not by much and the user experience for tablete, mobile and big screen is not going to be good.

The biggest takeaway from this project, is that it allowed me to learn precisely when and where to use grid and/or flexbox. Before that, I had trouble understaning why we would use flex when grid exists, but trying to be fluid based on an item content with grid is rather difficlt, and it's something the flex handles way better.

The hardest part for me was the start, and it's not about understanding grid and flex, it is more about looking at the page, seeing the mountain of things to do, and lose motivation to the point I had to push myself to get to a point where I could go "Yeah, i can do it". Meaning that, no matter how much there is to do, I now know that, so long as I tackle things little by little, one by one, I'll eventually do it and it'll feel great.
